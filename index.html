      <h2><u>More About Me</u></h2>
      <p>
        600 Character Write Up:<br> Inspired by my cousin who works in the field of IT, I became fascinated by the line of work. I dream of working in the IT field which is challenging yet fun for me. Robotics piqued my interest in software and hardware. In order to explore my interest and broaden my horizon, I took part in CaptureTheFlag competitions, such as YCEP, AYCEP by CSA, Amazing Race and more. I learnt a lot on ciphers and metadata and also did projects such as building a website using HTML. I wish to enrol in this course to become a software developer with full confidence that this course will make my dream a reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        1000 Character Write Up:<br> I am a Staff Sergeant, Sec 1 In-Charge, and Physical Training Instructor with strong leadership qualities in NCC. I am in charge of planning each NCC session and leading the entire platoon during Physical Training. I also played a key role in mentoring and guiding the Junior Cadets. During the pandemic, I made appreciation bags for construction workers to show my appreciation for them. I participated in YCEP and CTF.SG, achieving top 20 and top 40 positions respectively. I also took part in AYCEP, YCEP CCTF, Hack@AC, Threat Hunting Challenge, BrainHack and SEETF. I attended NP Amazing Race and won many prizes and valuable experience. During the competitions, I have learnt many things such as Steganography, Ciphers that use public and private keys, Regex, Binwalk. I self-taught many skills, such as Python, Kali, HTML,CSS, Javascript which is evident from my portfolio website. I did numerous projects like designing Blackjack using Python, the school NCC website and my Portfolio Website.

      <h2><u>Testimonials</u></h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Yong Shyan is a determined student who will put his heart and soul into something that he has
        interest in. My first impression of this young gentleman was when I saw him doing pull-ups during recesses
        religiously, taking his physical fitness seriously and trying out difficult moves, and in the process inspiring
        many others to follow. For a soft-spoken student, I thought he would find it difficult to be my Physical
        Training Instructor in National Cadet Corps (NCC). But the faith in his abilities showed me a different side
        of him. He was a natural leader who could inspire many of his juniors to see physical training as engaging
        and challenging! <br>
        Although he was not a Computing student in the school, he has a deep interest in computing as a
        subject. I was surprised that he was quite well-read in computing. Hence I offered him courses that were
        only offered to computing students. It further piqued his interest and curiosity. <br>
        At times where most student would just give up and wait for the answers to be shared, he would be
        determined to get the answer on his own. He was able to perform as well as some other computing students. <br>
        When the Amazing Race Virtual Hunter 2022 conducted by Ngee Ann Poly ended, Yong Shyan was very
        clear that he wanted to pursue Cyber Security in his next stage of education. I am sure that throughout the
        course of his development, Yong Shyan will be relentless in his pursuit once he decided on something he
        wants, as he has been demonstrating in his secondary school years.
